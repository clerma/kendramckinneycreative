A cover letter is the perfect way to bring your resume to life. It gives you the chance to share your story, show a bit of your personality, and explain why you're excited about the role. While your resume lists your qualifications, the cover letter connects the dots, showing how your unique skills and experiences match what the company needs. It's your opportunity to go beyond the bullet points, stand out from other applicants, and make a personal connection with the hiring manager, showing them why youâ€™re the right fit for the job.
