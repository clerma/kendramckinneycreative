A references page is like a behind-the-scenes spotlight on your professional journey. It gives potential employers a chance to hear firsthand about your work ethic, skills, and character from people who’ve worked closely with you. While your resume and cover letter tell your story, your references back it up with real-world examples, adding credibility and depth to your application. It’s a way to reinforce everything you've shared, showing that others trust in your abilities and would vouch for your success in a new role.
