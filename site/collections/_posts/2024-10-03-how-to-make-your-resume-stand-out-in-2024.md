The job market in 2024 is more competitive than ever, and with the rise of technology in hiring processes, creating a standout resume requires more than just listing your experience. Recruiters now use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes, which means your resume must be optimized for both technology and human eyes. So, how do you ensure your resume shines in this digital-first environment? Let’s break down the essential trends and tips to make your resume stand out in 2024.

### **1\. Optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)**

Most companies now use ATS software to filter resumes before they even reach a human recruiter. These systems scan resumes for specific keywords that match the job description, helping hiring managers identify the most qualified candidates. If your resume isn’t ATS-friendly, it may not even make it to the hiring manager’s desk.

#### **How to Optimize for ATS:**

* **Use Keywords Strategically:** Start by carefully reading the job description and identifying keywords, particularly the skills, qualifications, and experience the employer is seeking. Then, incorporate those exact words into your resume, especially in your skills section and job descriptions.
* **Stick to Standard Sections and Formatting:** ATS software reads standard sections like “Work Experience,” “Education,” “Skills,” etc. Avoid overly creative section titles that might confuse the system. Similarly, while creative formatting can look great to humans, ATS may struggle with complex designs, tables, or unusual fonts. Stick to simple, clean layouts.
* **Use an ATS-Friendly Template:** Consider using a professionally designed, ATS-friendly resume template. At **Kendra McKinney Creative**, we offer several templates designed to pass through ATS software while still looking polished when reviewed by a recruiter.

### **2\. Balance Hard and Soft Skills**

In 2024, employers are looking for well-rounded candidates who can demonstrate both technical proficiency (hard skills) and interpersonal capabilities (soft skills). While technical skills might get your resume noticed, soft skills can make you stand out from the competition.

#### **How to Highlight Hard Skills:**

* **Technical Proficiency:** Be specific and clear about your technical abilities. For example, instead of just saying “proficient in Microsoft Office,” mention specific tools or software, such as “advanced in Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, VLOOKUP),” or “proficient in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign).”
* **Certifications and Training:** If you’ve completed any recent certifications or training relevant to the job, include them in your resume. In fast-changing industries like technology or healthcare, showcasing continuous learning can be a huge advantage.

#### **How to Highlight Soft Skills:**

* **Communication, Leadership, Teamwork:** Don’t just list soft skills—demonstrate them through examples. For instance, instead of simply writing “excellent communication skills,” frame it within your work experience, like “led weekly team meetings and presented quarterly performance reviews to executive leadership.”
* **Custom Soft Skills for Each Job:** Tailor your soft skills to the job description. For example, if the role requires problem-solving or time management, mention a project where you delivered results under tight deadlines or resolved a team conflict.

### **3\. Customize for Each Job**

One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make is sending the same resume for every application. In 2024, customization is key. Tailoring your resume to each specific job not only improves your chances with ATS but also makes it clear to recruiters that you’ve taken the time to understand the role.

#### **How to Customize Your Resume:**

* **Adjust Your Summary:** Start with a tailored resume summary or objective that highlights your most relevant experience and skills for the position. For example, if applying for a marketing role, you might write, “Marketing professional with 5+ years of experience in digital strategy, SEO optimization, and content creation for B2B and B2C markets.”
* **Prioritize Relevant Experience:** Focus on the most relevant job experience and skills for the role you’re applying for. If a job calls for project management skills, make sure your past roles highlight leadership, timelines, and resource management.
* **Target the Company’s Needs:** Research the company and its values. If they prioritize innovation and collaboration, reflect those qualities in your work history. For example, mention times when you led innovative projects or collaborated cross-functionally to solve problems.

### **4\. Use Clean Formatting and a Modern Design**

While content is king, presentation still matters. Your resume should be easy to read, clean, and professional, making it simple for recruiters to scan and pick out the most important details. A modern, polished design can leave a strong impression, but it’s essential to keep things simple enough to remain ATS-friendly.

#### **Formatting Tips for 2024:**

* **Use White Space:** A cluttered resume can overwhelm recruiters. Use white space to separate sections clearly, making it easy to skim for key information.
* **Limit to One or Two Pages:** Keep your resume concise. For most professionals, a one-page resume is ideal unless you have 10+ years of experience in a relevant field, in which case two pages may be acceptable.
* **Bullet Points, Not Paragraphs:** Use bullet points to list your accomplishments and responsibilities in past roles. Recruiters often skim resumes, and bullet points are much easier to digest than long paragraphs.
* **Focus on Metrics:** Wherever possible, quantify your achievements. Instead of saying, “Managed social media accounts,” say, “Increased social media engagement by 40% over six months by implementing a targeted content strategy.”

#### **Design Tools for Help:**

At **Kendra McKinney Creative**, I offer resume templates that strike the perfect balance between modern design and ATS compatibility. Whether you need a sleek, minimalist look or something with a bit more flair, my templates will help your resume stand out.

### **5\. Emphasize Accomplishments, Not Duties**

Instead of listing basic job duties for each role, focus on accomplishments that showcase your impact. Employers want to know how you made a difference in your past jobs, so highlight any measurable results you achieved.

#### **How to Highlight Accomplishments:**

* **Use Numbers to Show Impact:** Metrics make your resume more credible. For example, “Increased sales by 25% in Q3 through targeted email marketing campaigns” or “Reduced operating costs by 15% by implementing a new inventory management system.”
* **Tailor Accomplishments to the Role:** If applying for a leadership role, emphasize leadership accomplishments, such as “Managed a team of 12 and improved project delivery times by 20%.”

### **Final Thoughts: Stand Out With the Right Tools**
