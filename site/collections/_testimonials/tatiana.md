blurb: >-
  Kendra took a resume that was plain, boring and 5 years old and made it
  magical! She was so thorough in finding out what I had been doing, and about
  what I was looking for in the future. She even went above and beyond to help
  me navigate a few things while I was in the interview process. Even if you
  feel like your resume is perfect, I promise you, Kendra will make it better!!
